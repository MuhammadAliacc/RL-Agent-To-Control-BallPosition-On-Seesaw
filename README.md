#RL Agent to Control Ball Position on Seesaw

This repository contains the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent and PID controller for a seesaw control system. The RL agent is designed to train in a simulation environment before being deployed on the actual hardware.

Key Features:
RL Agent: Trains in simulation to achieve precise control of the ball's position on the seesaw.
PID Controller: A classical approach for real-time control and comparison with the RL agent's performance.
Integration with Flask Server: The control system is seamlessly managed through a Flask-based dashboard, providing an intuitive interface for:
Monitoring the system.
Sending control commands.
This repository complements the Flask server setup found here:
[Flask for Seesaw Control System](https://github.com/MuhammadAliacc/Flask-For-Seesaw-Control-System)

Explore this project to see how RL and PID methods can work together to achieve efficient control in dynamic systems. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
